# Dragon API - HTTP API for Linux & Systemd
## Very WIP

This project started because I wanted to learn Zig.  
And what is the better way of learning zig than to build something to interact with low-level Linux stuff?  
So I am mixing it all to learn more about systemd, Linux and programming in low level language ^^

## Run project
All you need to do is clone this repo and run:
```sh
zig build run
```

## Planned features
* [x] Journald logs reading
* [ ] Units management with systemd
* [ ] Resources monitor
* [ ] Processes management
* [ ] Writing to STDIO of selected process! (If it's possible lol)
* [ ] Filesystem access
